# Task


Follow these steps:

● Create an HTML file called index.html. You may need to create other webpages, but this will be your homepage that acts as the landing page for your website.

● Create at least 2 other pages (this could include pages such as “about me”, “contact details”, etc., or even different categories of your hobby, e.g. “starters”, “main courses” and “desserts” if you’re show-casing recipes).

● Within the entirety of your site, you should have the following elements:

○ At least 5 images.

○ At least 3 font sizes (to help differentiate sections).

○ At least 2 external links (maybe to another website, or an email address).

○ At least 1 table.

○ At least 1 list (ordered or unordered, you can choose).

○ At least one submit button form (possibly to subscribe to a newsletter — don’t worry about the functionality of this yet).

○ At least one radio button form (e.g. you could ask a future subscriber what types of recipes they’d like to receive).

○ At least one quote/testimonial

○ At least 2 blocks (i.e text with a background).
